INSTALL for sdhash 

recent versions of sdhash has been tested on the following platforms:

Fedora Core 17 64 bit
Ubuntu 12.04LTS 64 bit
Mac OS X 10.7 Lion
Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard

As of sdhash 3.1 we are moving to 64-bit capable -sse4.2 processors
only -- in order to take advantage of dramatically faster comparison rates.

Windows 7 32 and 64-bit 

32-bit windows will be supported for a short amount of time via creative
ifdefs.

64-bit gpu program requires nvidia drivers but no toolkit.

See INSTALL.macosx and BUILD.windows for non-linux build
and installation notes.

SHORT VERSION on Linux:

Check for openssl-devel (fedora) or libssl-dev (ubuntu) package.  

make
make install (as root) 

For the server:  

Install apache thrift 0.8.0 - we have a .deb package for ubuntu.

make server
make install-server

For the GPU version: 

the CUDA toolkit is required to build, and nvidia drivers are necessary to run.  

cd sdhash-gpu ; make 

REQUIREMENTS

openssl development libraries.
pthreads development library
openmp library -- generally installed
g++ - will work all the way down to 4.2 -- but try to use later versions
g++ - which includes -sse4.2 compatibilty.  

ETC 

See manpage for usage of sdhash.  By default we install into /usr/local/bin
and this can be changed in the Makefile or with make DESTDIR=dir
